# Transformer_tutorial
Build a Transformer from scratch to do simple translation tasks.

Dataset only contains two sentences, so the model maybe overfits, but the main idea is to learn the structure of Transformer, so it's not a big problem.

Only use basic torch models and other fundanmental packages to build the Transformer, which helps us to understand how it works.
